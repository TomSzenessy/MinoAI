# Semantic Search Status

Semantic indexing services exist in server internals, but there is currently no public REST endpoint exposed at `/api/v1/search/semantic`.

Use:

- `GET /api/v1/search` for public full-text search today.

When semantic REST routes are exposed, this page should be updated with request/response contracts.
